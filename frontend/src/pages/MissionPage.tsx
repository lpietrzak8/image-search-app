      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        In a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, we believe that true creativity still begins with real people.
        <br /><br />
        Our mission is to connect technology with genuine human artistry — making it easier than ever to find authentic, high-quality photographs created by talented photographers around the world.
        <br /><br />
        We celebrate the craft, emotion, and perspective that only real artists can capture.
        <br /><br />
        By combining intelligent search tools with a curated database of human-made photography, we aim to honor and support the photographers who bring meaning, beauty, and authenticity to visual storytelling.
        <br /><br />
        Because while AI can generate images, only humans can create art.
